# version_1

This folder, `version_1`, serves as the foundational stage in the development process of our project. It contains the initial set of scripts and files that were created to generate data for the main project repository. Key aspects of this folder include:

- **Initial Codebase**: The scripts and files here represent the early, human-generated codebase. They were crafted swiftly to meet the immediate needs of data generation for the project.
- **Data Generation Focus**: The primary purpose of the code in this folder was to generate the raw data needed for the project's README and other documentation, emphasizing functionality over refinement.
- **Baseline for Improvement**: This version acts as a baseline for subsequent refinements. It is in the `version_2_ai_refined_code` folder where this original code is enhanced and optimized with AI assistance.
- **Documentation of Development Journey**: By preserving this initial version, we document the evolution of the project's codebase, showcasing the natural progression from a quick, functional approach to a more refined and optimized one.

Note: While the code in this folder was crucial for the initial data generation, it was later improved upon in the `version_2_ai_refined_code` folder, demonstrating the continual process of development and refinement in software projects.
