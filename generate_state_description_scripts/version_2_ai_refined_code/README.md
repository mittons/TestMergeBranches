# version_2_ai_refined_code

This folder houses AI-refined versions of the original scripts and files located in the `version_1` folder. The `version_1` folder's content primarily consisted of rapidly developed, human-generated code used for generating data for the main project repository. Key highlights of this folder include:

- **AI Enhancement**: The code in this folder has been refined with the assistance of AI, focusing on optimizing structure, improving readability, and ensuring best coding practices.
- **Testing and Validation**: To ensure that the AI's refinements didn't alter the core functionality, output from the revised code (`test/new_output.txt`) was rigorously compared against the base output (`test/base_output.txt`) using `test/compare_outputs.py`.
- **Showcase of AI Collaboration**: This folder serves as a demonstration of how AI can assist in refining and improving code written by human developers, enhancing both efficiency and code quality.

Note: The files in this folder were not directly used in generating the final output for the project's README, but they offer valuable insights into the iterative process of code refinement and the potential of AI-assisted development.
